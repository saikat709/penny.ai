## How to Test

To test the extension, you can load it as a temporary add-on in Firefox:

   1. Open Firefox and navigate to about:debugging.
   2. Click on "This Firefox" in the left-hand menu.
   3. Click the "Load Temporary Add-on..." button.
   4. Navigate to the directory where you saved the extension files and select any file within that directory.

  The extension will now be loaded, and you can test its functionality by opening and closing a tab from a website like Amazon or
  eBay.
